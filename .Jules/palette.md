## 2024-05-24 - Upgraded Contact Links to Badges
**Learning:** Utilizing Shields.io badges instead of raw markdown links for contact information creates a larger, more accessible click target for users, especially on mobile devices. It also significantly improves the visual consistency across the profile by matching the style used in the technical skills section.
**Action:** Default to using consistent badge components or similarly styled interactive elements for important external links to improve visual UX and click target accessibility.
