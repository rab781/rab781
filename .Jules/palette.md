## 2024-10-24 - Consistent Badge Usage for Contact Links
**Learning:** Using consistent visual elements (Shields.io badges) for contact links instead of plain text improves the visual hierarchy and provides larger, more accessible click targets, matching the existing "Technical Skills" section style.
**Action:** When working on profile READMEs, check for visual consistency between skills and contact sections. Suggest converting text lists to badges where appropriate to enhance delight and usability.
